= Updraft: Umpteenth Portable Document Renderer And Formatting Tool

Updraft is a lightweight library for generating PDF files in Ruby.

It was inspired by the easy to use FPDF.php and the Ruby port FPDF.rb.

Updraft should run in Ruby 1.8.x, 1.9.x, JRuby, and likely others.

This library supports the most common operations that I needed.

If you find this interesting, please fork and improve it.

Cheers,

Steve
