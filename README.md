updraft - Umpteenth Portable Document Renderer And Formatting Tool
==================================================================

## Description

Updraft is a lightweight library for generating PDF files in Ruby.

It was inspired by the easy to use [FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org/) and
the [Ruby port](http://zeropluszero.com/software/fpdf/).

Updraft should run in Ruby 1.8.x, 1.9.x, JRuby, and likely others.

This library supports the most common operations that I needed.

If you find this interesting, please fork and improve it.

Cheers,

Steve
